# domoticz-pzem-016 

This is a plugin for the free open-source [Domoticz home automation system](https://www.domoticz.com) that **read one or more PZEM-014, PZEM-016, PZEM-004T energy meters by Modbus connection** (RS485 serial connection), providing the following data: 
* active power
* active energy
* voltage
* current
* frequency
* power factor

![Screenshot of devices created by domoticz-pzem-016 Domoticz plugin on smartphone](https://images.creasol.it/domoticz-pzem-016-screenshot.webp)

The following items can be configured:
* Bitrate, by default 9600 bps
* Meter address, for example 1 (only one meter with address 1) or 11,12 (two devices with address 11 and 12: address should be separated by comma)
* Poll interval, in seconds: in case of a long list of devices, don't use very short poll intervals!

![Domoticz plugin configuration](https://images.creasol.it/domoticz-pzem-016-hardware.png)

PZEM-014 and PZEM-016 have RS485 port: one or more modules can be connected together by a standard "sensor alarm cable" (2x 0.22mmÂ² wires + shield), 
and then connected to Domoticz controller (Raspberry PI or other hardware) by using a cheap RS485/USB adapter or a RS485/net controller. Please remember
that RS485 bus should be terminated in both ends by a 120 Ohm resistor.

![PZEM-016 or PZEM-014 wiring schematic](https://images.creasol.it/PZEM-016_wiring.png)

PZEM-004T has TTL outputs, so it can be connected to the controller by a TTL to serial adapter. 

![PZEM-004T wiring schematic](https://images.creasol.it/PZEM-004T_TTL_USB.webp)

Please note that while it's possible to easily connect many PZEM-016 and PZEM-014 to the same RS485 bus, to connect many PZEM-004T to a single TTL/USB interface some modifications are needed.


## Setting a different address to a PZEM-014, PZEM-016 or PZEM-004T meter 

From Linux it's possible to change the address of a meter (by default it's set to 1) by using the following command, that changes address from 1 to 11:
```
mbpoll -mrtu -Pnone -a1 -b9600 -0 -1 -r2 /dev/ttyUSB0 11
```
/dev/ttyUSB0 have to be replaced with the right serial port.

Using other operating systems, please use a Modbus client to set the register address 2 (base-0) to the new slave address value, using function code 6.

This plugin does not open the serial port in exclusive-mode, so it's possible to share the same serial port for many different devices; for example, it was successfully tested with 1 PZEM-016 energy meter and 1 EMMETI MIRAI heat pump (same bitrate, with different slave address of course).

# Installation

This plugin can be installed from [Python Plugin Manager](https://github.com/ycahome/pp-manager) or [Python Plugins Manager](https://github.com/stas-demydiuk/domoticz-plugins-manager) which also permit to update plugin easily or automatically.

Alternatively, it's possible to give the following commands from the linux shell:

```
cd ~/domoticz/plugins
git clone https://github.com/CreasolTech/domoticz-pzem-016
```

Then, in the future, to update the plugin it's possible to simply type
```
cd ~/domoticz/plugins/domoticz-pzem-016
git pull
```

It uses the python plugin module minimalmodbus , than can be installed by
```
sudo apt install pyserial
sudo pip3 install minimalmodbus
```


Restart Domoticz, then go to Setup -> Hardware and add the Emmeti Mirai heat pump plugin, specifying a name for that hardware and the serial port to connect heat pump.

## Creasol DomBus modules

Below a list of modules, produced in Europe by Creasol, designed for Domoticz to be reliable and optimized for very very low power consumption.

Our industrial and home automation modules are designed to be
* very low power (**around 10mW with relays OFF**)
* reliable (**no disconnections**)
* bus connected (**no radiofrequency interference, no battery to replace**).

Modules are available in two version:
1. with **DomBus proprietary protocol**, working with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) only
2. with **Modbus standard protocol**, working with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org)

### DomBusEVSE - EVSE module to build a Smart Wallbox / EV charging station
<a href="https://store.creasol.it/DomBusEVSE"><img src="https://images.creasol.it/creDomBusEVSE_plug_300.webp" alt="DomBusEVSE smart EVSE module to make a Smart Wallbox EV Charging station" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" align="left" /></a>
Complete solution to make a Smart EVSE, **charging the electric vehicle using only energy from renewable source (photovoltaic, wind, ...), or adding 25-50-75-100% of available power from the grid**.

* **Single-phase and three-phase**, up to 32A (8kW or 22kW)
* Needs external contactor, RCCB (protection) and EV cable
* Optional power meter to measure charging power, energy, voltage and power factor
* Optional power meter to measure the power usage from the grid (not needed if already exists)
* **Two max grid power thresholds** can be programmed: for example, in Italy who have 6kW contractual power can drain from the grid Max (6* 1.27)=7.6kW for max 90 minutes followed by (6* 1.1)=6.6kW for another 90 minutes: in this case **the EVSE module can drain ALL available power** when programmed to charge at 100% **minimizing the charge time and increasing the charging efficiency**.
* **Works without the domotic controller** (stand-alone mode), and **can also work in *managed mode*, with an automation in the home automation system setting the charging current**
