# domoticz-pzem-016 

This is a plugin for the free open-source [Domoticz home automation system](https://www.domoticz.com) that **read one or more PZEM-014, PZEM-016, PZEM-004T energy meters by Modbus connection** (RS485 serial connection), providing the following data: 
* active power
* active energy
* voltage
* current
* frequency
* power factor

![Screenshot of devices created by domoticz-pzem-016 Domoticz plugin on smartphone](https://images.creasol.it/domoticz-pzem-016-screenshot.webp)

The following items can be configured:
* Bitrate, by default 9600 bps
* Meter address, for example 1 (only one meter with address 1) or 11,12 (two devices with address 11 and 12: address should be separated by comma)
* Poll interval, in seconds: in case of a long list of devices, don't use very short poll intervals!

![Domoticz plugin configuration](https://images.creasol.it/domoticz-pzem-016-hardware.png)

PZEM-014 and PZEM-016 have RS485 port: one or more modules can be connected together by a standard "sensor alarm cable" (2x 0.22mmÂ² wires + shield), 
and then connected to Domoticz controller (Raspberry PI or other hardware) by using a cheap RS485/USB adapter or a RS485/net controller. Please remember
that RS485 bus should be terminated in both ends by a 120 Ohm resistor.

![PZEM-016 or PZEM-014 wiring schematic](https://images.creasol.it/PZEM-016_wiring.png)

PZEM-004T has TTL outputs, so it can be connected to the controller by a TTL to serial adapter.

## Setting a different address to a PZEM-014 or PZEM-016 meter 
From Linux it's possible to change the address of a meter (by default it's set to 1) by using the following command, that changes address from 1 to 11:
```
mbpoll -mrtu -Pnone -a1 -b9600 -0 -1 -r2 /dev/ttyUSB0 11
```
/dev/ttyUSB0 have to be replaced with the right serial port.

Using other operating systems, please use a Modbus client to set the register address 2 (base-0) to the new slave address value, using function code 6.

This plugin does not open the serial port in exclusive-mode, so it's possible to share the same serial port for many different devices; for example, it was successfully tested with 1 PZEM-016 energy meter and 1 EMMETI MIRAI heat pump (same bitrate, with different slave address of course).

# Installation

This plugin can be installed from [Python Plugin Manager](https://github.com/ycahome/pp-manager) or [Python Plugins Manager](https://github.com/stas-demydiuk/domoticz-plugins-manager) which also permit to update plugin easily or automatically.

Alternatively, it's possible to give the following commands from the linux shell:

```
cd ~/domoticz/plugins
git clone https://github.com/CreasolTech/domoticz-pzem-016
```

Then, in the future, to update the plugin it's possible to simply type
```
cd ~/domoticz/plugins/domoticz-pzem-016
git pull
```

It uses the python plugin module minimalmodbus , than can be installed by
```
sudo apt install pyserial
sudo pip3 install minimalmodbus
```


Restart Domoticz, then go to Setup -> Hardware and add the Emmeti Mirai heat pump plugin, specifying a name for that hardware and the serial port to connect heat pump.

**Plugin can be easily translate in other languages**: just add the language code to LANGS variable, and add a field to each device with the translated name of device. Please send a copy of the plugin.py file to linux at creasol dot it

## Creasol DomBus modules
Our industrial and home automation modules are designed to be
* very low power (**around 10mW with relays OFF**)
* reliable (**no disconnections**)
* bus connected (**no radiofrequency interference, no battery to replace**).

Modules are available in two version:
1. with **DomBus proprietary protocol**, working with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) only
2. with **Modbus standard protocol**, working with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org)

Complete solution to make a Smart EVSE, **charging the electric vehicle using only energy from renewable source (photovoltaic, wind, ...), or adding 25-50-75-100% of available power from the grid**.

* Single-phase and three-phases, up to 36A (8kW or 22kW)
* Needs external contactor, RCCB (protection) and EV cable
* Optional power meter to measure charging power, energy, voltage and power factor
* Optional power meter to measure the power usage from the grid (not needed if already exists)
* **Two max grid power thresholds** can be programmed: for example, in Italy who have 6kW contractual power can drain from the grid Max (6* 1.27)=7.6kW for max 90 minutes followed by (6* 1.1)=6.6kW for another 90 minutes. **The module can use ALL available power** when programmed to charge at 100%.
* **Works without the domotic controller** (stand-alone mode), and **can also work with charging current set by the domotic controller (managed mode)**
